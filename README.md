# Package Unpacker
Shell script that allows for the unpackaging of a zipped project into the directory of your choice. Built with Hostgator's shared server in mind.

## Usage
Run `unpacker.py <zipped package> <final location>`. 
On Hostgator run  `hostgator-runner.sh <zipped package> <final location>`. 

## Future Flags
`-d` to unzip project into existing directory instead of creating a new directory.
`-h` to provide host specific settings from a file.
